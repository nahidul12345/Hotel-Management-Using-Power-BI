# Hotel-Management-Using-Power-BI

🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Data Dashboard Project! 🏨📊
I’ve just wrapped up creating an interactive Hotel Management Dashboard that provides key insights into booking trends, revenue, and cancellations. Here's a glimpse of what the dashboard covers:
💼 Total Bookings: 119.4K
💵 Total Revenue: $29.6M
📉 Revenue Loss: $13.1M
⚖️ Average Cancellation Rate: 37%
This dashboard also helps forecast future bookings and provides breakdowns by:
Lead time groups and their impact on cancellations
Distribution channels, allowing data-driven decision-making for optimizing revenue streams
I've used Power BI for visualizations and data analysis, which brings real-time metrics to life for hotel management teams to make more informed decisions.
